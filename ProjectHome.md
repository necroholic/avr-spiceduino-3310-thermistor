This project shows the use of a simple thermistor to measure temperature and display the temperature graphically on a Nokia 3310 LCD. Thermistors are incredibly cheap (about 50 cents), and provide fraction of a degree accuracy. The Nokia 3310 Library originally written by CC Darmini was modified yet again, this time to use per pixel access while maintaining the ability to draw text.
